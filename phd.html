<h1>PhD in Software Engineering</h1>

          I am currently recruiting PhD candidates to work on software engineering topics. I am particularly interested in model-based software engineering, software quality and testing, software analytics, and mining of software repositories.

          <!--h3>What is Model-Driven Engineering?</h3>
          MDE is a cutting-edge approach to Software Engineering that leverages domain-specific models and techniques such as code-generation, model simulation,
          and model transformation, to boost the productivity of software engineers and the quality of the produced software. MDE is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JuhaPekkaTolvanen/industrial-experiencesondomain-specificmodeling">used extensively in industry</a> for the development of large-scale complex software systems.-->

         <h3> Required background </h3>
		 
		 You need to have a good first degree in Computer Science, or Software Engineering. You should have strong object-oriented design and development skills, good ideas of your own, and the desire to work independently. You also need to be able to demonstrate accomplishment: what have you done in the past? What have you completed? This might be a project that you have finished, software that you have built, a paper that you've had published, etc.


		 <h3>Who will I be working with?</h3>

          You will be working with an international world-class team of academics, post-doctoral researchers and PhD students. Our research group has a strong track record of collaboration with industry and we are leading the development of one of the most widely-adopted open-source model-based software engineering platforms, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon">Epsilon</a>,
          which is <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/users">used in organisations and companies</a> such as NASA, BAE Systems, IBM, Thales and Siemens. In the last national research assessment (REF 2014), the Department of Computer Science <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/ref-2014-results-by-subject/2017594.article">ranked joint 7th with Oxford</a> (among 89 CS departments in the country) for the quality of our research.

         
          <h3>How can I apply for a PhD?</h3>
          You can apply for a PhD through the University's <a>online system</a>. Please note that the most important part of your application will be your <b>research proposal</b>, where you are expected to explain the topic you wish to investigate in your PhD. 

          <h4>Writing a research proposal</h4>

          There is a lot of good advice on the web on how to write a good research proposal, including:
          <p/>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/wiki/pub/Mi/PromotionsVerfahren/Lauer75.pdf">Discussion on Ph.D. thesis proposals in Computing Science</a> - H. C. Lauer, Newcastle University</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/phd-research-proposal.shtml">Writing a research proposal for applying for a Ph.D. in Computer Science</a> - Hayo Thielecke, University of Birmingham</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.findaphd.com/advice/finding/writing-phd-research-proposal.aspx">Writing a Good PhD Research Proposal</a> - FindAPhD.com</li>
          </ul>

          Common problems in research proposals I have received over the last few years include:

          <ul>
            <li><b>Lack of hypothesis/evaluation plan</b>: Some proposals suggest developing a piece of software or a methodology without explaining the problem it is meant to solve or presenting a convincing evaluation plan. In your proposal you should try to clearly answer the following questions.
            <ol>
              <li> Which specific problem will the proposed software/methodology solve?
              <li> Why is this problem important? Has it been identified as a problem by other researchers?
              <li> Is there any previous work on solving this problem in the literature? If so, what are its limitations that you wish to address in this work?
              <li> Once you have developed the software/methodology you are proposing, how will you evaluate that it actually solves the problem it targets? 
              <li> What resources are required for your evaluation?  (e.g. if you are planning to develop a methodology that needs to be evaluated by software practitioners, how are you going to get hold of them?)
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Too broad/narrow</b>: While a PhD is all about doing novel research and choosing your own path, you should keep in mind that it is a 3/4-year undertaking and that a non-negligible proportion of this time will be spent on reviewing literature, writing reports, papers etc. As such, an ambition to e.g. <em>"simplify the development of cloud-based applications" </em>is obviously unrealistic if you are referring to every possible type of cloud-based application. Of course on the flip side there are proposals with very limited ambition (e.g. a trivial extension of the applicant's BSc/MSc thesis).</li>
            
          </ul>

          Before you start writing your proposal, it is usually a good idea to <a href="../../contact">contact me first</a> so that we can discuss whether the topic you have in mind is in line with my research interests. In your introductory email, please:
          <ul>
            <li> attach copies of your CV and transcripts
            <li> briefly explain how you plan to fund your PhD studies (i.e. are you applying for / have you already secured a scholarship? do you require funding from the University of York?)
          </ul>
            
          If you don't have a specific topic in mind, I am happy to suggest a few topics that are aligned with my current research.

          <h3>What is the typical duration of a PhD in the group?</h3>
          The typical duration of a PhD is 3-4 years. Being in a world-leading position in the field of model-driven engineering means that
          we will be able to help you select a cutting-edge topic for your PhD project so that you can engage in productive and fruitful research
          from the first year of the programme. In fact, many of our PhD students start publishing novel results from as early as the
          second year of their project.

          <h3>What about scholarships?</h3>
          Please have a look at <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/postgraduate/research-degrees/phdstudentships/">this page</a>
          for information regarding available University/Department scholarships/funding. When additional scholarships are available (e.g. from funded research projects in which I am an investigator), I announce them <a href="../phd-scholarships">on this page</a>.
