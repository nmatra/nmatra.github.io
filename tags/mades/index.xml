      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MADES project was a Specific Targeted Research Project (STREP) of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7). MADES aimed to develop a holistic, model-driven approach to improve the practice in the development of embedded systems. The proposed approach covered all phases, from design to code generation and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design activities in MADES exploited a dedicated language developed as an extension to OMG&amp;rsquo;s MARTE Profile. Validation activities played a key role in the context of MADES and they included the verification of key properties on designed artefacts, closed-loop simulation based on detailed models of the environment, and the verification of designed transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code generation addressed both hardware description languages and conventional programming languages with features for compile-time virtualisation of common hardware architecture features, including accelerators, memory, multiprocessor and inter-processor communication channels, to cope with the fact that hardware platforms are getting more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
