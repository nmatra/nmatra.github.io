      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is increasingly applied to larger and more complex systems, the current generation of modelling and model management technologies are being pushed to their limits in terms of capacity and efficiency, and as such, additional research is imperative in order to enable MDE to remain relevant with industrial practice and continue delivering its widely recognised productivity, quality, and maintainability benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the MONDO project is to tackle the increasingly important challenge of scalability in MDE in a comprehensive manner. Achieving scalability in modelling and MDE involves being able to construct large models and domain specific languages in a systematic manner, enabling teams of modellers to construct and refine large models in a collaborative manner, advancing the state-of-the-art in model querying and transformations tools so that they can cope with large models (of the scale of millions of model elements), and providing an infrastructure for efficient storage, indexing and retrieval of large models.&lt;/p&gt;
