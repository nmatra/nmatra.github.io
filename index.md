I am a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/) at the University of York, where I teach and research software engineering. From July 2015 until August 2018, I was a lecturer at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of York in 2011 under the supervision of [Richard Paige](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~paige/) and [Kiran Fernandes](https://www.dur.ac.uk/business/research/management/profile/index.php?mode=staff&amp;id=11444).


My research falls into the broad area of systems and software engineering. My goal is to help engineers produce more reliable systems in an economic and timely manner. My main line of research is in automated and model-driven engineering. Beyond automated and model-driven engineering I am interested in data analytics for software engineering, software quality and testing, and in technologies for persisting and analysing large volumes of heterogeneous data. In my research I integrate knowledge  from fields as diverse as model-driven engineering, machine learning, distributed systems, and software analysis and testing.

If you are interested in doing a PhD with me, please [read on](./phd.html).
